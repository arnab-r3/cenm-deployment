It may take a few minutes for the public IP to be available. You can watch the status of by running this command (and watching column 'EXTERNAL-IP'):

    kubectl get --namespace {{ .Release.Namespace }} svc -w {{ include "nmap-ip.fullname" . }}

You can later get public IP address again by running this command:

    kubectl get svc --namespace {{ .Release.Namespace }} {{ include "nmap-ip.fullname" . }} --template "{{"{{ range (index .status.loadBalancer.ingress 0) }}{{.}}{{ end }}"}}"
